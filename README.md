# JobRec: Job Recommendation System

## Introduction

JobRec is a job recommendation system that uses graph-based algorithms and tree structures to provide personalized job recommendations to users. The system integrates the Findwork.dev API to fetch real-time job listings and implements efficient matching algorithms based on user profiles and job requirements.

## Features

- **Graph-Based Job Matching**: Sophisticated matching algorithm using directed graphs to model job requirements and user skills
- **Tree Structure for Job Categories**: Hierarchical organization of job categories and skills for efficient matching
- **Real-time Job Listings**: Integration with Findwork.dev API for up-to-date job opportunities
- **User Profile Management**: Comprehensive profile creation and management system
- **Job Application Tracking**: Built-in system for tracking job applications and interview schedules
- **Smart Notifications**: Automated alerts for new matching jobs and application updates
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Insights into application success rates and job market trends

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- Modern web application built with React.js
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
- Interactive user interface for profile management and job browsing
- Real-time updates and notifications

### Backend
- Python-based server using FastAPI
- Integration with Findwork.dev API for job data
- Graph-based matching algorithm implementation
- Tree structure for job categorization
- Secure authentication and data management
- RESTful API endpoints for frontend communication

### Database
- PostgreSQL for structured data storage
- Redis for caching and real-time features
- Efficient data models for user profiles and job listings
- Graph database integration for relationship modeling
